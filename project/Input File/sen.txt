Data mining, the extraction of hidden predictive information from 
large databases, is a powerful new technology with great potential 
to help companies focus on the most important information in their 
data warehouses. Data mining tools predict future trends and 
behaviors, allowing businesses to make proactive, knowledge-driven 
decisions. The automated, prospective analyses offered by data 
mining move beyond the analyses of past events provided by 
retrospective tools typical of decision support systems.
